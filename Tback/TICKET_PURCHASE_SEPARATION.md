# Ticket Purchase System - Separate from Payment Model

## âœ… Goal Achieved

**Requirement:** Ticket purchases should be saved in `TicketPurchase` model (visible at `/admin/tickets/ticketpurchase/`) and NOT in the `Payment` model, which should be reserved only for destination bookings.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Summary

### **Database Separation:**
- **Ticket Purchases** â†’ `TicketPurchase` model in `tickets` app
- **Destination Bookings** â†’ `Payment` model in `payments` app
- **Clean separation maintained** - no cross-contamination

### **Admin Interface:**
- **Ticket Purchases:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/tickets/ticketpurchase/
- **Destination Payments:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/payments/payment/

### **API Endpoints Created:**

#### Direct Ticket Purchase Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/tickets/purchase/direct/                    - Create ticket purchase
GET    /api/tickets/purchase/{id}/status/               - Check purchase status  
POST   /api/tickets/purchase/{id}/complete/             - Complete purchase
GET    /api/tickets/purchase/{id}/details/              - Get purchase details
POST   /api/tickets/purchase/{id}/simulate-payment/     - Simulate payment (demo)
GET    /api/tickets/purchases/user/                     - User's purchases
GET    /api/tickets/purchases/debug/                    - Debug/admin view
```

### **Features Implemented:**

1. **Independent Ticket Purchases:**

   - Inline ticket codes display
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Purchase status management

4. **Testing Tools:**
   - Management command: `python manage.py test_ticket_purchase`
   - API testing scripts

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

### **Database Records:**
- **Ticket Purchases:** 2 records in `TicketPurchase` model
- **Destination Payments:** Separate records in `Payment` model
- **Ticket Codes:** 4 generated codes for ticket validation

### **Test Results:**
