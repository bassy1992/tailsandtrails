# 🎫 TICKET PURCHASE ERROR FIX

## 🚨 **Problem**
Frontend showing: **"Payment successful but failed to create ticket. Please contact support."**

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### Issue 1: Payment Method Mismatch
- **Frontend was sending**: `'mtn_mobile_money'` (from `momoProvider.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '_')`)
- **Backend expected**: `'mtn_momo'`
- **Result**: 400 Bad Request - "Invalid payment method"

### Issue 2: Missing Payment Reference Connection
- Ticket purchases weren't properly linked to successful payments
- Direct purchase endpoint was creating its own payment references instead of using provided ones

### Issue 3: VIP/Premium Price Mismatch  
- VIP tickets cost 270.00 (base price * 1.8)
- Backend was using base ticket price (150.00) instead of actual amount paid
- Result: Amount mismatch between payment and ticket purchase

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. Fixed Payment Method Mapping (Frontend)
**File**: `Tfront/client/pages/TicketCheckout.tsx`

```typescript
// Added proper payment method mapping
const getPaymentMethodCode = (provider: string): string => {
    const mapping: { [key: string]: string } = {
        'MTN Mobile Money': 'mtn_momo',
        'Vodafone Cash': 'vodafone_cash',
        'AirtelTigo Money': 'airteltigo_money'
    };
    return mapping[provider] || 'momo';
};

// Updated API call to use correct payment method
payment_method: getPaymentMethodCode(momoProvider),
```

**Before**: `'mtn_mobile_money'` ❌  
**After**: `'mtn_momo'` ✅

### 2. Fixed Payment Reference Connection (Backend)
**File**: `Tback/tickets/purchase_views.py`

```python
# Use provided payment reference if available
payment_reference = data.get('payment_reference')

if payment_reference:
    purchase.payment_reference = payment_reference
    # If we have a real payment reference, the payment was already processed
    purchase.status = 'confirmed'
    purchase.payment_status = 'completed'
    purchase.payment_date = timezone.now()
else:
    # Create own reference for direct purchases
    purchase.payment_reference = f"TICKET_{purchase.purchase_id}"
```

### 3. Fixed VIP/Premium Pricing (Backend)
**File**: `Tback/tickets/purchase_views.py`

```python
# Use provided total amount for VIP/Premium tickets
provided_total = data.get('total_amount')
if provided_total:
    # Use the provided total amount (e.g., for VIP/Premium tickets)
    total_amount = float(provided_total)
    unit_price = total_amount / quantity
else:
    # Use base ticket price
    unit_price = ticket.discount_price if ticket.discount_price else ticket.price
    total_amount = unit_price * quantity
```

**File**: `Tfront/client/pages/TicketCheckout.tsx`

```typescript
// Added total_amount to API call
body: JSON.stringify({
    ticket_id: purchaseData.ticketId,
    quantity: purchaseData.quantity,
    total_amount: purchaseData.totalAmount, // ← Added this
    // ... other fields
})
```

## 🎯 **Complete Flow Now Working**

### 1. User selects VIP ticket (270.00)
- Frontend calculates VIP price: `base_price * 1.8 = 150 * 1.8 = 270`
- Stores in localStorage as `purchaseData.totalAmount = 270`

### 2. Payment creation
- Frontend sends payment request with `amount: 270.00`
- Payment system creates payment with correct amount
- Payment auto-completes successfully

### 3. Ticket purchase creation
- Frontend calls `/api/tickets/purchase/direct/` with:
  - `payment_method: 'mtn_momo'` ✅ (was `'mtn_mobile_money'` ❌)
  - `total_amount: 270` ✅ (preserves VIP pricing)
  - `payment_reference: 'PAY-...'` ✅ (links to actual payment)

### 4. Backend processing
- Validates payment method: `'mtn_momo'` ✅ (accepted)
- Uses provided total amount: `270.00` ✅ (VIP price preserved)
- Links to actual payment: `payment_reference` ✅ (proper connection)
- Creates ticket purchase with status: `'confirmed'` ✅
- Generates ticket codes automatically ✅

### 5. Success response
- Frontend receives `{ success: true, purchase: {...} }`
- Navigates to success page with ticket codes
- User gets their VIP tickets immediately

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Payment: 270.00 (successful)
- ❌ Ticket Purchase: Failed with "Invalid payment method"
- ❌ Frontend: "Payment successful but failed to create ticket"

### After Fix:
- ✅ Payment: 270.00 (successful)  
- ✅ Ticket Purchase: 270.00 (successful, properly linked)
- ✅ Frontend: Success page with ticket codes
- ✅ Admin: Both payment and ticket purchase show 270.00

## 🎉 **Result**

The **"Payment successful but failed to create ticket"** error is now **completely resolved**!

Users can successfully:
- ✅ Purchase VIP tickets (270.00)
- ✅ Get immediate ticket codes after payment
- ✅ See proper amounts in admin panels
